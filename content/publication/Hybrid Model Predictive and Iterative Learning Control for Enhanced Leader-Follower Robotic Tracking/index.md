abstract: |
    This paper presents a novel hybrid control strategy combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Iterative Learning Control (ILC) for leader-follower tracking in mobile robots. The primary objective is to enhance the tracking accuracy and robustness of the follower robot as it trails a leader robot in dynamic environments. 

    The MPC component predicts the future states of the follower robot over a finite horizon and optimizes the control inputs to minimize a cost function that includes positional and orientation errors as well as control efforts. Meanwhile, the ILC component refines the control inputs by learning from errors observed in previous iterations. 

    Implemented within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework for real-time communication and control, our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid MPC-ILC approach. Significant improvements in tracking accuracy and control efficiency are showcased compared to using MPC or ILC alone. 

    For more detailed information, the complete source code is available at GitHub, highlighting the practical applications and effectiveness of our proposed method in real-world scenarios.
